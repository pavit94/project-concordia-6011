\section{Testing of Function F7: x$^y$}
    \subsection{Introduction}
    The function provided for the testing purpose is x$^y$ which is a power function. The team member has provided all the required documents to perform the testing of a function.
    \subsection{Test Step}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The source code is imported into Eclipse and compiled.
        \item The program is run for different inputs and results were verified.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \subsection{Test Results}
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{||c c c||} 
     \hline
     Requirements & Description & Result \\ 
     \hline\hline
     R1 & Valid inputs within the given range & PASS \\ 
     \hline
     R2 & Any base value is raised to the power zero & PASS \\
     \hline
     R3 & Base value zero is raised to any exponent value & PASS \\
     \hline
     R4 & Non-numeric throws exception & PASS \\
     \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    
    \subsection{Conclusion}
    From the above, all the methods of power function are tested and found a positive response. Also, there are no errors found during the testing process. The test cases cover all the requirements as specified in Problem 2. In addition to this, test cases are fast and precise.
