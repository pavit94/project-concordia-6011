\section*{Problem 2}
The assumptions and requirements for the function \[x^y\] as per ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 standards.

\subsection*{2.1 Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Assumption 1
\begin{itemize}
\item ID:       ASSUMP1
\item Version:  1.0
\item Type:     functional
\item Owner:    Pavit Srivatsan
\item PRIORITY: 1 
\item Difficulty: Easy
\item DESC: fractional inputs are entered as double values
\item Rationale: when input base or exponent value equals $2/3$, it must be expressed as 0.67
\end{itemize}
\item Assumption 2
\begin{itemize}
\item ID:       ASSUMP2
\item Version:  1.0
\item Type:     functional
\item Owner:    Pavit Srivatsan
\item PRIORITY: 1 
\item Difficulty: medium
\item DESC: The output of larger values of exponent and base are expressed in terms of exponents 
\item Rationale: when input is 100 raised to 100, the output is expressed as 1.9047931533522278E25
\end{itemize}
\item Assumption 3
\begin{itemize}
\item ID:       ASSUMP3
\item Version:  1.0
\item Type:     functional
\item Owner:    Pavit Srivatsan
\item PRIORITY: 2 
\item Difficulty: High
\item DESC: Users enter whole numbers and rational numbers
\item Rationale: Irrational numbers are not handled by the code.For Example: $\pi$, $\surd 2$
\end{itemize}
\item Assumption 4
\begin{itemize}
\item ID:       ASSUMP4
\item Version:  1.0
\item Type:     functional
\item Owner:    Pavit Srivatsan
\item PRIORITY: 3
\item Difficulty: Easy
\item DESC: Mathematical symbols such as infinity, indeterminate are represented in words
\item Rationale: Symbols such $\infty$ are represented in words - infinity
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2.2 Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Requirement 1
\begin{itemize}
\item ID:       FUNR1
\item Version:  1.0
\item Type:     functional
\item Owner:    Pavit Srivatsan
\item PRIORITY: 1 
\item Difficulty: Easy
\item DESC: The arguments passed to the function x power y shall be valued within $-\propto to +\propto$ and fractions are expressed as double values.
\item Rationale:when $x=2.2$, $ y = 4.45$ where x expressed in radians.
\end{itemize}
\item Requirement 2
\begin{itemize}
\item ID:       FUNR2
\item Version:  1.0
\item Type:     functional
\item Owner:    Pavit Srivatsan
\item PRIORITY: 2 
\item Difficulty: Easy
\item DESC:  The function shall return the value 1 when any base value is raised to the power zero
\item Rationale: 10 raised to the power 0 returns 1
\end{itemize}
\item Requirement 3
\begin{itemize}
\item ID:       FUNR3
\item Version:  1.0
\item Type:     functional
\item Owner:    Pavit Srivatsan
\item PRIORITY: 2
\item Difficulty: Easy
\item DESC: The function shall return zero when base value zero is raised to any exponent value
\item Rationale: 0 raised to the power 10 returns 0
\end{itemize}
\item Requirement 4
\begin{itemize}
\item ID:       FUNR4
\item Version:  1.0
\item Type:     functional
\item Owner:    Pavit Srivatsan
\item PRIORITY: 2
\item Difficulty: Medium
\item DESC: The function shall accept only numerical values as specified in the domain
\item Rationale: string values, numbers with special characters, special characters are not allowed as inputs and an appropriate error message is displayed
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
